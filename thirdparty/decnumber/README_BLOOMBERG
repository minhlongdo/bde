This directory contains a copy of the DecNumber library version 3.68.

The upstream library can be obtained from
http://speleotrove.com/decimal/

The following changes have been made from the upstream:

- The "decnum.pdf", which contains the library documentation, has been removed.
  The library documentation can be found at the upstream web address.

- The mode of the source files have been changed to be no longer executable.

- Created 'wscript' file to build using waf, because the DecNumber library did
  not come with a build system.

Note that the set of C source files linked into the library (defined in the
wscript) correspond to the set of modules mentioned in the "Modules" section
of the decNumber documentation (http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decnumber.html).
Other C source files contained in this directory are either usage examples or
files pound included by the actual modules source files.  When this package is
updated, care should be taken to ensure that the set of C source files defined
in the wscript is up-to-date.
