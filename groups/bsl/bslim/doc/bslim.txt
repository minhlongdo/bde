@PURPOSE: Provide implementation mechanisms.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Standard Library Implementation Mechanisms (bslim)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bslim' package provides implementation mechanisms that are
 typically used to implement functionality provided by other components.  For
 example, 'bslim_printer' greatly simplifies the implementation of standard BDE
 'print' methods having this interface:
..
  bsl::ostream& print(bsl::ostream& stream,
                      int           level          = 0,
                      int           spacesPerLevel = 4) const;
..
 The 'bslim_testutil' component provides a set of macros that are widely used
 in the test drivers of other BDE components.

/Hierarchical Synopsis

 The 'bslim' package currently has 2 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
