@PURPOSE: Support for multi-threading and thread-safe processes.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Concurrency Environment Multi-Threading (bcemt)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bcemt' package supports primitives that allow creation and
 management of operating system threads.  Using the components in 'bcemt',
 clients can write efficient, thread-safe code.

 Thread creation and management of mutually exclusive locks (mutexes) are
 supported in a way that should be familiar to developers with experience
 programming in threads on any common computing platform.  In addition,
 individual components such as 'bslmt_lockguard' and 'bslmt_barrier' manage
 synchronization concerns through simple, idiomatic object interfaces that make
 client code easy to read and understand.

/Thread Management
/-----------------
 Thread management is done via the utility class 'bcemt_ThreadUtil' in the
 'bcemt_thread' component.  This component presents a platform-independent
 protocol whose operations nonetheless correspond closely to native operations
 on platform-specific threads.  'bcemt_ThreadUtil' presents a procedural
 interface -- that is, clients do not instantiate 'bcemt_ThreadUtil' objects,
 and all methods of 'bcemt_ThreadUtil' are declared 'static'.

 Clients create threads with the functions
 'bcemt_ThreadUtil::create(Handle*, ...)'.  On success, these functions yield a
 'bcemt_ThreadUtil::Handle' object that provides a lightweight handle for an
 operating systems thread.  Similarly, clients destroy threads for which they
 have a current 'Handle' with 'bcemt_ThreadUtil::terminate(Handle*)'.

 'bcemt_ThreadUtil' supports two 'create()' functions.  The first function
 simply takes a pointer to a 'bcemt_ThreadUtil::Handle'; the second function
 takes a 'bcemt_Attribute' object that defines component-specific and
 platform-specific attributes of the created thread.  Platform-specific
 attributes include scheduling policy and priority, and thread stack size.  See
 the {'bcemt_thread'} component documentation for details.

/Thread Synchronization
/----------------------
 The 'bcemt' package contains several components and classes that support
 thread synchronization in a number of ways.

/Basic Mutexes: 'bcemt_Mutex' and 'bcemt_RecursiveMutex'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 At the lowest level, synchronization between threads is done with
 'bcemt_Mutex', a type defined in component 'bcemt_thread'.  Locks are acquired
 with 'bcemt_Mutex::lock()' or 'bcemt_Mutex::tryLock()', and released with
 'bcemt_Mutex::unlock()'.  The 'bcemt' package provides several other
 mechanisms for synchronization and communication, which suit specific
 synchronization problems and allow more idiomatic C++ coding.

 'bcemt_RecursiveMutex' is similar to 'bcemt_Mutex', except that it can be
 'lock'ed multiple times *in* *a* *single* *thread*.  A corresponding number of
 calls to 'unlock()' are required to unlock the mutex.  'bcemt_RecursiveMutex'
 is also defined in component 'bcemt_thread'.

/Inter-thread Condition Variables: 'bcemt_Condition'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The 'bcemt_Condition' class, defined in component 'bcemt_thread', implements a
 "condition variable" that can be used by multiple threads to communicate
 changes in the condition.  Multiple threads wait on the condition by calling
 'myCondition->wait(bcemt_Mutex*)', suspending their execution and waiting.  An
 individual thread then signals when the condition is met by calling either
 'myCondition->signal()' (waking up a single waiting thread) or
 'myCondition->broadcast()' (waking up all waiting threads).  Waits with
 timeouts are supported through 'bcemt_Condition::timedWait()'.

/Locking/Unlocking critical code
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Code in multiple threads can create a 'bcemt_Mutex' and call 'mutex->lock()'
 and 'mutex->unlock()' to guarantee exclusive access to critical sections of
 code.  A more idiomatic usage is provided by 'bcemt_LockGuard' and
 'bcemt_UnLockGuard'; objects of these types themselves lock and unlock a
 'bcemt_Mutex' when they are created or destroyed, allowing clients to manage
 mutex locks in a way more transparent, safer way, and also making sure the
 lock is released when an exception is thrown within the critical section.
..
  static void myThreadsafeFunction(myObject *obj, bcemt_Mutex *mutex)
  {
      // creating the LockGuard calls mutex->lock()
      bcemt_LockGuard<bcemt_Mutext> guard(mutex);
      if (someCondition) {
          obj->someMethod();
          return;
          // LockGuard is destroyed; this calls mutex->unlock()
      } else if (someOtherCondition) {
          obj->someOtherMethod();
          return;
          // LockGuard is destroyed; this calls mutex->unlock()
      }
      obj->defaultMethod();
      return;
      // LockGuard is destroyed; this calls mutex->unlock()
  }
..

/Thread-Specific storage
/- - - - - - - - - - - -
 Thread-specific storage (also known as thread-local storage, or TLS) is a
 mechanism for referring to a single variable (identified by its 'Key' in
 'bcemt_ThreadUtil', provided by the 'bcemt_thread' component) whose content
 varies according to the thread it is obslrved in.  This is useful for status
 variables such as 'errno', which is implemented by the system as a TLS, since
 otherwise it would be impossible to use 'errno' values in a thread, not
 knowing if another thread had modified it after the last system call in this
 thread.

/Synchronization of Multiple, Parallel Threads: 'bcemt_Barrier'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 The 'bcemt_barrier' component provides a single class, 'bcemt_Barrier', that
 can be used to synchronize processing among multiple threads.  The
 'bcemt_Barrier' is created with a single argument specifying the number of
 threads to synchronize.  Each individual thread then calls 'myBarrier->wait()'
 when it reaches its synchronization point.  All waiting threads are blocked
 until the required number of threads have called 'myBarrier->wait()'; once the
 required number is reached, the threads are released and can continue
 processing.

/One Writer/Multiple Readers: 'bcemt_ReaderWriterLock'
/- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Component 'bcemt_readerwriterlock' provides a single class,
 'bcemt_ReaderWriterLock', that supports multi-reader, single-writer locks.
 Applications can use 'bcemt_ReaderWriterLock' to allow concurrent read access
 from multiple threads to data that changes infrequently.  By calling
 'bcemt_ReaderWriterLock::lockRead()', reading threads are not blocked until a
 writing thread requests a write lock (for instance, by calling
 'bcemt_ReaderWriterLock::lockWrite()').  While the write lock is in effect,
 access is serialized and all threads that have called 'lockRead()' will wait
 until the write lock is released with 'bcemt_ReaderWriterLock::unlockWrite()'.

 Note that reader/writer locks also have their own guards, provided by
 'bcemt_readlockguard' and 'bcemt_writelockguard' components.

/Recursive Write Locks: 'bcemt_RecursiveRWLock'
/ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 This component is *DEPRECATED*.  It can be emulated by a wrapper on a
 'bcemt_ReaderWriterLock' along with a thread-specific counter used to store
 the number of recursive locks acquired by the current thread.

/Static Initialization
/- - - - - - - - - - -
 Initialization of a thread-specific static variable (such as a thread-local
 singleton) can be achieved by using the 'bcemt_once' component.  The
 'bcemt_qlock' component ensures thread-safe static initialization of shared
 resources by providing a light-weight, statically initializable lock.  Note
 that the classic 'bcemt_Mutex' provided by the 'bcemt_thread' component cannot
 safely be used in static initializations because some platforms (e.g., Windows
 XP) do not have a native statically-initializable mutex type.

/Implementation Classes and Components
/-------------------------------------
 The 'bcemt' package is supported on all Bloomberg platforms.  In order to
 accomplish this, 'bcemt' provides platform-specific implementations of thread
 primitives.  The following components provide platform-specific
 implementations:
..
            Package          |  Purpose
  +==========================+===========================================+
  |         bcemt_threadimpl | Template declarations used by             |
  |                          | component 'bcemt_thread'                  |
  | bcemt_threadimpl_pthread | Template specialization for POSIX threads |
  |   bcemt_threadimpl_win32 | Template specialization for MS-Windows    |
  +--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
..
 These components are visible and documented.  However, their intended use is
 to support component 'bcemt_thread'.  Clients should not expect to use them
 directly.
