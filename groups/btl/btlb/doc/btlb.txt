@PURPOSE: Provide flexible, efficient management of message buffers.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Library Blobs (btlb)

@DESCRIPTION: This package defines, 'btlb::Blob', a vocabulary type for other
 'btl' packages.  A 'btlb::Blob' object consists of a sequence of
 'bltb::BlobBuffer' objects, each of which have a shared pointer to underlying
 memory.  A protocol is defined for factories to manage 'bltb::BlobBuffer'
 objects, and a concrete implementation is provided.  Other components define
 non-primitive operations on 'btlb::Blob's.
