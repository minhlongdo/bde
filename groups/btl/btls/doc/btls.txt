@PURPOSE: Provide transport-specific system level services.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Environment System-level services (btls)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'btls' package provides "system level" services that are
 required by this transport package group in a form that is portable across all
 suported platforms.  Currently, the package supplies objects and utilities to
 implement the Unix 'iovec' ("scatter/gather") buffer structure in a
 platform-neutral form.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'btls' package currently has 5 components having 2 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
