@PURPOSE: Provide support, services, and frameworks for transport (IPC)

@MNEMONIC: Basic Transport Environment (btl)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'btl' ("Basic Transport Environment") package group provides
 a variety of concrete transport (IPC) mechanisms and services that conform to
 a uniform set of pure abstract interfaces.  In addition, 'btl' supplies
 low-level support for sockets and event managers.

/Package Overview
/----------------
 This section provides a brief introduction to some of the packages in 'btl'
 package group.  See the respective Package Level documents for more details.

/'btlmt'
/- - - -
 The {'btlmt'} package provides a multi-threaded framework that supports
 TCP/IPv4 transport.  In functionality, 'btlmt' is similar to 'ptdispatch'
 except that there is no support for 'fstsnd' at this time.

/'btls'
/ - - -
 The {'btls'} package provides "system level" services that are required by
 this transport package group in a form that is portable across all suported
 platforms.  Currently, the package supplies objects and utilities to implement
 the Unix 'iovec' ("scatter/gather") buffer structure in a platform-neutral
 form.

/'btls5'
/- - - -
 {'btls5'} provides connectivity through a network of SOCKS5 proxies with
 optional username/password authentication.

/'btlsc'
/- - - -
 The {'btlsc'} package provides a suite of protocols (i.e., pure abstract
 interfaces) abstracting the general behavior of communications "channels".
 All abstractions in this package consider stream-based (as opposed to
 message-based) transport.  The three general abstractions are called
 "channel", "channel allocator", and "allocator factory".  In our usage,
 "allocator" and "factory" are synonymous; we use different words to avoid
 repetition.  In simplest form, "channel" abstracts the concept of an endpoint
 of a communication mechanism, providing appropriate "read" and "write"
 methods, while a "channel allocator" dispenses channels as resources, and
 hence abstracts the concepts of creating and destroying channels.  Finally, a
 "(channel) allocator factory" is substantially a naming service that is
 capable of dispensing channel allocators that will in turn dispense channels
 that are appropriately connected of concrete event managers.  Each of the
 above interfaces is available in blocking and non-blocking form, and with and
 without support for timeouts.

/'btlso'
/- - - -
 The {'btlso'} package provides relatively low-level support for sockets as
 well as a number of concrete event managers.

/'btlsos'
/ - - - -
 The {'btlsos'} package provides concrete impementations of 'btlsc' channels
 using TCP/IPv4 sockets.  Timed and untimed, and blocking and non-blocking
 versions of generic channels, acceptors, and connectors are provided.
